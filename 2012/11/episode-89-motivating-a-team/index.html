<p><em>Transcript</em></p>
<p><strong>Jade Meskill</strong>:  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Agile Weekly Podcast. I&#8217;m Jade Meskill.</p>
<p><strong>Drew LeSueur</strong>:  I&#8217;m Drew LeSueur.</p>
<p><strong>Derek Neighbors</strong>:  I&#8217;m Derek Neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>Roy van de Water</strong>:  I&#8217;m Roy van de Water.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Guys, I wanted to talk about a hypothetical situation where what if the team that you&#8217;re working in has lost its motivation? You find yourself in a coaching role, a mentoring role, and the people that you&#8217;re working with just seem to have lost all their energy, really not making any forward progress. What would you do if faced with that situation?</p>
<p><strong>Drew</strong>:  I&#8217;m thinking maybe something, an activity, or something to spark the joy that they maybe once had in that. I don&#8217;t know what that would be, but try to get them to remember the joy that they had at one time.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  To me, I think it depends. Do I know what&#8217;s causing it? Is it that they&#8217;re just working a ton of hours? Is it that they&#8217;re only working on defects? Is it that they don&#8217;t understand the product and the market? Is it that nobody is adopting the product?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  They hate the people they&#8217;re working with?</p>
<p><strong>Drew</strong>:  They hate their coach?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  What are some of the symptoms or potential causes?</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Let&#8217;s say that they&#8217;re working at a sustainable pace. Nobody is burning the midnight oil, or anything like that. They have a reasonable idea of where they&#8217;re supposed to be going, they just don&#8217;t seem to be real excited about going there.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  I think motivation is this kind of tricky thing, that you have to really buy into it. If they&#8217;re not motivated in going there, I&#8217;m assuming that it&#8217;s one of two reasons. Either that where they&#8217;re being asked to go really doesn&#8217;t have a lot of meaning, and they actually know that, and their way of actualizing that is by disengagement.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that where they&#8217;re going is meaningful, but whoever is asking them to go there hasn&#8217;t done a good job of providing that meaning in enough detail to get them excited about the journey.</p>
<p>I think if people aren&#8217;t excited about the direction that something is going, or where it&#8217;s going, the barrier that it creates for them to actually be engaged can become to the point where it&#8217;s significant enough you can&#8217;t overcome it.</p>
<p>Some of that depends on the people. Some people are fairly excitable. It doesn&#8217;t take a whole lot to get them excited about going somewhere. Some people are real sticks‑in‑the‑mud and you really have to fight, maybe even on a daily basis, to keep them going in a direction.</p>
<p>I would probably say, if that was the case, I would start with asking myself, &#8220;Does this team really have a compelling vision and reason for going where they&#8217;re going?&#8221; If the answer is &#8220;Yes,&#8221; start doing something to get them down the path of realizing the impact of the work they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>Until I could do that, there is probably not a lot of tricks I could do that would last more than a week or so. I might be able to temporarily engage them in something, but the truth is, &#8220;Let&#8217;s work on this fun new thing for a little bit!&#8221; As soon as the fun‑ness wears off then we&#8217;re right back to where we started. I think it&#8217;s always got to be the root of, they&#8217;ve got to believe where they are going.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Now is it my turn? Is that why you guys are staring at me?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  [laughs] I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t have any opinions, not in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  [laughs] That&#8217;s a lie!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine that we&#8217;ve tried a few of the things to boost the energy, and like Derek said, it&#8217;s had a short‑term positive effect but its kind of worn down and now we&#8217;re out of tricks.</p>
<p>This team still says that they still want to go in the direction that they&#8217;re heading, at least that&#8217;s what they say on the surface. Is it OK to have a season where you&#8217;re not making a whole lot of progress?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  I would say that if the team was not making forward momentum, the answer is &#8220;No,&#8221; but I think it&#8217;s OK to say, maybe for this particular thing, &#8220;Hey, if we&#8217;re not making progress in this, we&#8217;re not moving forward with this particular thing, and none of us can be energized to get behind it, maybe we say, &#8216;For right now, yeah, we believe that&#8217;s a good direction to be going in, something that&#8217;s worth doing.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we can&#8217;t find the motivation to do it maybe we need to move into, &#8216;What does motivate us? Where is somewhere we want to go?&#8217; Maybe we go through that until we get out of whatever that funk is.&#8221; Meaning, sometimes maybe you need a distraction. Maybe it&#8217;s a week, maybe it&#8217;s a day, maybe it&#8217;s a month, to basically be re‑energized back to level set.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Do you run the risk of chasing the new shiny?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Yeah, I think that most teams, that&#8217;s their problem. that they don&#8217;t really understand where and why they&#8217;re going somewhere.</p>
<p>They think they do, but they don&#8217;t actually know, so when the rubber hits the road, and you get to what I&#8217;d call &#8220;The grind,&#8221; or &#8220;The hard part,&#8221; or &#8220;The dip,&#8221; as Seth Godin would say, I think it becomes like, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t so great. It&#8217;s not so shiny, it&#8217;s not so fun. I know I really want it, but I don&#8217;t really want it bad enough to push forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that, at that point, you either have to decide, &#8220;Hey, am I going to go a different direction?&#8221; but you run the risk of, do you constantly just run the other direction when you hit the dip? Or do you say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have to push through. I&#8217;m going to have to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think sometimes, to me I think maybe that&#8217;s where a coach&#8230;Maybe that&#8217;s where external factor, maybe it&#8217;s a jerk on the team, somebody who pushes that issue and says, &#8220;One or the other, go.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can talk a little bit from an analogy perspective. I&#8217;ve got a daughter that plays pretty high‑level competitive soccer, and I think she lost, I won&#8217;t say &#8220;Her interest.&#8221; I think if I asked her, &#8220;Yeah, I still want to play in the US women&#8217;s national team, but you know what? It&#8217;s a lot of work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m spending four hours a night, four nights a week doing this, playing on the weekends. I&#8217;m getting screamed at, and it&#8217;s emotionally difficult, and everything else.&#8221; I told her, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just quit? Why don&#8217;t you take a break for a while, you just play high school soccer, and don&#8217;t do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was like, &#8220;No, I really don&#8217;t want to.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, you know you&#8217;re not performing, you&#8217;re not having this.&#8221; She got a new coach, and this particular coach is a role model for her, played on the US women&#8217;s national team. Can speak her language, and was really hard on her, and pulled her aside and said, &#8220;Look, if you really, truly, want this, what you&#8217;re currently putting in, you will never get there.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re telling me you want this. I&#8217;m going to sit you on the bench, and I will not play you until you show me that that&#8217;s what you really want.&#8221; It took her about two weeks of a lot of weeping and gnashing of teeth, and now she is more committed than ever.</p>
<p>I think sometimes you have to look into the the fire and say, &#8220;Is this what I really want? If it is, how do I dig into that deeper level to get there?&#8221; The problem is that that&#8217;s deeply personal. It&#8217;s very difficult to do that at a team level.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  But is that part of the problem of a team who&#8217;s lost their motivation? That at a personal level, they haven&#8217;t dealt with those things?</p>
<p>Especially if many of the people on the team are in that same situation, it&#8217;s a lot easier to just avoid it and focus on some of the surface level things that are going on. Instead of really, really digging down and saying, &#8220;OK, is this really what I want? Am I willing to cry about this, and get really upset, and finally work my way through it at a personal level, and now I can deal with it at a team level&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  I think a lot of it too is, usually what I see happening in those aspects are there&#8217;s some level of sacrifice involved.</p>
<p>In my daughter&#8217;s case, &#8220;I can&#8217;t spend a night in anybody&#8217;s house on Friday and Saturday, because I&#8217;ve got games all weekend. I get no sleep, because by the time I get home from soccer practice it&#8217;s eight or nine o&#8217;clock at night. By the time I eat and I do my homework, it&#8217;s 11 o&#8217;clock at night, and I have to be back up at 5 o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>All of these things are like, &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m missing all this other stuff, and so every day, it&#8217;s a decision, &#8216;Do I do this or do I do that?&#8217; and the &#8216;This&#8217; isn&#8217;t immediate. Spending the night with my friends is immediate satisfaction, and I had a great time spending that with my friends. Training and going to the game does not have immediate satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether I win that game or I lose that game, I&#8217;m not going to try out for the women&#8217;s national team for four more years. I have to learn how to delay my gratification on what I&#8217;m putting a sacrifice for, for a significant amount of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think as individuals and especially teams, that&#8217;s usually where it&#8217;s at. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;I have to make this decision of, &#8216;Do I piss this person off?&#8217;, or, &#8216;Do I miss out on this thing?&#8217;, or &#8216;Do I do this right now, today?&#8217; for something that I don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;s actually attainable. I don&#8217;t even know if I can actually get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that yeah, that&#8217;s deeply personal stuff. Then I think it cascades and complicates, because you can&#8217;t do any of those things by yourself. In my daughter&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s pretty much on her, probably, to be able to make the national team or not.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re talking a company, you&#8217;re talking a team, or you&#8217;re talking a product, one person can&#8217;t deliver a product. One person can&#8217;t deliver whatever. Now you&#8217;re lying faith in other people to push through whatever they&#8217;re going through as well.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  What could we recommend for a team that&#8217;s maybe facing this crisis of faith in wherever it is that they&#8217;re heading? What is it that we could encourage them to try to do to work through a lot of the personal issues before they can even bring it to the team?</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll probably have to rework through the forming, storming, norming again after you&#8217;ve dealt with this internal issue.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Just chase the new shiny. It&#8217;s a lot easier than when you go to work.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  It&#8217;s more fun too.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I think each person on a team has to take assessment of where they&#8217;re at, where they want to be. Do they really want to go whatever direction the team is looking to do with their product or whatnot, and say, &#8220;Is this something I can get in alignment on?&#8221;</p>
<p>If the answer is &#8220;Yes&#8221;, then I think that they have to look back to everybody else on the team that is in the same boat and then say, &#8220;How do we help each other get there? How do we hold ourselves to be accountable?&#8221;</p>
<p>I see this a lot of times. I like my sports analogies. You see this a lot of times on teams too. One of the premier teams that I coached for a long time, they really had this whole concept of &#8220;Be excellent.&#8221;</p>
<p>What they would do is they would really hold each other to that standard. If somebody passed somebody a ball that wasn&#8217;t a great ball, they would say, &#8220;I demand excellence.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t a rude thing, it was, &#8220;We&#8217;re all going to remind each other that if we really want to win a state championship, we&#8217;re only as good as our weakest pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;It only takes one failure in defense to give up a goal. It only takes missing one shot to not score a goal. In this sport it&#8217;s a difference of one goal when you&#8217;re at that level, so we have to demand that of each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s making that internal commitment to each other. To say, &#8220;If we&#8217;re all making the personal commitment to this, now we need to make the team commitment to that same thing, whatever that level is.&#8221; Not only so you have accountability, but so that you have the ability to help each other to that level.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  If you&#8217;re not in alignment on those things, it&#8217;s going to be very difficult to do that. If a few people on the team are pushing in that direction, I think it&#8217;s going to be very abrasive to the rest of the people who aren&#8217;t on board with that.</p>
<p>What happens if people don&#8217;t want to get on board or go through that trial?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  If nobody on the team wants to do that, then obviously the team needs to find what they do want, something that aligns to their personal piece. If you&#8217;ve got part of a team does, part of a team doesn&#8217;t, do you split into two teams? If it&#8217;s one or two people, does it make sense?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this happen. Going back to the sports analogies, LeBron James would be a great example of this. &#8220;Cleveland Cavaliers, we&#8217;re not going to win a national championship. I want a national championship. I&#8217;m willing to take less money to go somewhere where I can win a national championship, because for me, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being the superstar, or the highest paid or whatever, that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m looking for. I&#8217;m looking for a ring, because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m getting criticized for. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m interested in, and I make that move.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not saying that necessarily the other people on the Cavaliers didn&#8217;t want it, but their general office wasn&#8217;t willing&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  They weren&#8217;t willing to leave to do it?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Their general management wasn&#8217;t willing to spend the money to get the other supporting cast members to do it.</p>
<p>I think that that&#8217;s part of it too, when you&#8217;re dealing with skills gaps or other things. Sometimes you have to say, &#8220;If we really want to get to here, we&#8217;re trying to achieve this, you have to be realistic.&#8221; What does that mean for each person on the team? What do they have to do to be able to help the team get there?</p>
<p>At that point they might say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not good enough to be on this team. I need to be on another team and make do with that, or I need to step up my game, or I need to get a personal trainer.&#8221; Whatever that thing is.</p>
<p>I want to be on a team that travels more. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important to me. I don&#8217;t care if we win games. Maybe I&#8217;m just trying to get recruited for college, so I want to be on a team. I don&#8217;t care if they&#8217;re any good or not, from that standpoint. I don&#8217;t care if they win a state championship, I just want to be seen by college coaches.</p>
<p>Whatever your goal is, if you don&#8217;t have personal alignment it&#8217;s impossible to be on a team that has team alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  That&#8217;s the re‑occurring theme that I keep hearing through this whole discussion. If you don&#8217;t know what you want, it&#8217;s going to be impossible to work together as a collective to get what you want.</p>
