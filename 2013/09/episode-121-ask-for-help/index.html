<p><em>Transcript</em></p>
<p><strong>Jade Meskill</strong>:  Hello, welcome to another episode of the Agile weekly podcast, I&#8217;m Jade Meskill.</p>
<p><strong>Derek Neighbors</strong>:  I&#8217;m Derek Neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>Roy Van de Water</strong>:  I&#8217;m Ron Van de Water.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Roy, will you tell me what we&#8217;re talking about today?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Today we will be talking about asking for help.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Oh! Will you help me figure out the next question?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  No.</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Derek, will you help me with the next question?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  What&#8217;s the next question?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  The next question is, &#8220;When should you ask for help?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  When should you ask for help?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  All the time.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  All the time? You just don&#8217;t know anything?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  When shouldn&#8217;t you ask for help?</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  That leads to a good question. Why don&#8217;t people ask for help? If you should do it all the time, why don&#8217;t people do it?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  I think a lot of people are probably afraid to be perceived as not knowing something, as OK as that is. Obviously, there&#8217;s nobody in the world that knows everything.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Do smart people ask for help?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Wise people ask for help. I don&#8217;t know about smart people.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  I think there&#8217;s some cultural baggage around that. In some cultures it&#8217;s perceived as if you ask questions it means you&#8217;re dumb.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  It&#8217;s a sign of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Yeah. I&#8217;ve talked to people where they feel they ask questions during a job interview, and they feel like the candidate Googled an answer, for example, then that is looked down upon. That is a point against the candidate, and they&#8217;ll probably not get hired.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  What do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  What, Googling?</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  If somebody did that in front of you while you were trying to interview them?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  If they don&#8217;t know the answer, and they&#8217;ve asked me and I don&#8217;t know the answer, and they don&#8217;t Google it, I would be like, &#8220;Have you not heard of this? Have you been living under a rock?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  If I&#8217;m hiring people, I don&#8217;t care if they know the answer themselves, I just want them to produce the product. If they rip it all off of Google, as long as it&#8217;s legal I don&#8217;t care how they get around it.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  I think there&#8217;s some stubbornness involved, also. There&#8217;s some people who feel like &#8220;If I give you something you have to give me something in return. Therefore, if I ask you for help, then somehow I&#8217;m enslaved to you, and you could pull that card out at any time.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  So I&#8217;m in &#8220;Help debt.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Maybe I don&#8217;t want to get into debt.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Maybe the opposite. Because there&#8217;s also a lot of cultural baggage around being asked for help. Especially when you look at how people ask for help normally. They say, like, &#8220;Derek, please close the door.&#8221; It&#8217;s not really asking, so you don&#8217;t get to really say &#8220;No.&#8221; By me asking for help, I&#8217;m kind of socially obligating you to help me.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  If I said, for example, I need one of you to volunteer to [indecipherable 03:13] this podcast, that would not be asking for help?</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  No, you&#8217;re kind of commanding help.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  I&#8217;ve heard that called being &#8220;Volun‑told.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Volun‑told, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  My immediate reaction to that is, &#8220;Screw you, buddy! I&#8217;m not going to help you. Don&#8217;t tell me what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know that I don&#8217;t like to ask for help. I have a hard time with it. I like to know things, and I like to learn things and figure them out. I&#8217;ll definitely Google things, I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. But maybe the more subtle or insidious things, that I&#8217;m surrounded by smart people who probably have the answer, but instead I&#8217;m going to be dumb and learn it the hard way.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  I wonder, too, if there is a bit of trust that&#8217;s missing. If I ask somebody for help and they provide it, now all of the sudden I have to take their help, almost, because I asked for it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying you actually have to, but socially it&#8217;d be really awkward if I asked Derek for help, and he gave me help and I said, &#8220;Nah, that&#8217;s not the help I&#8217;m looking for. I don&#8217;t want your help anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Yeah, I think that we think it&#8217;s this really high cost thing, too. In reality the amount of time it takes me to ask for help is the entirety of the investment, and if I get the help I gained a whole lot for the amount of time that I asked for it. But if I get a &#8220;No,&#8221; or I get help that doesn&#8217;t really apply, I&#8217;m no worse off than I was before I asked for help, except for the small amount of time I spent asking for help.</p>
<p>I think that we forget that. We forget that it&#8217;s a really low cost thing to do, because it takes a lot of courage to do it. It feels expensive even though it&#8217;s really cheap. I think for me, a lot of times I&#8217;ll be OK at asking for help if it&#8217;s present and in my face.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m sitting here struggling with a technical problem and the two of you are sitting in the room, I&#8217;m probably pretty likely, the minute that I get blocked, to ask one of you two, because I know you&#8217;re both really bright and know technology.</p>
<p>But if the two of you aren&#8217;t in the room, but you&#8217;re on the end of a chat channel across the way, and I don&#8217;t have that chat channel open and I run into the exact same problem, I might fight with it for 30 minutes before I go, &#8220;Oh, wait! I could get ahold of them on IM!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes I think presence makes it difficult too. If the people that we think are available to be helpful aren&#8217;t immediately present, we don&#8217;t think about&#8230;the barrier of typing an email and waiting 10 minutes for a response is probably still better than beating my head into the wall for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Or we think that people maybe don&#8217;t know the answer. Gangplank is a really interesting place, which is a collaborative workspace that we&#8217;re in a lot, where we record this podcast. It&#8217;s not uncommon, if there&#8217;s 50, 60 people in the room, that you might pop up and say, &#8220;Hey, will somebody help me by telling me where a pair of scissors are?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really low‑cost, and the reality is somebody probably knows where those scissors are. But if I sit there and look at all 50 people, and I say, &#8220;I have no idea which one of these 50 people would know where the scissors are,&#8221; I might not ask any of them.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s getting over the barrier of, even when you don&#8217;t know who can help you, sometimes just saying, &#8220;I need help&#8221; is helpful. The person drowning that says, &#8220;I&#8217;m drowning,&#8221; generally gets a life raft. The person that doesn&#8217;t say that doesn&#8217;t get the life raft.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  It&#8217;s interesting, because people in general like to help. People like to receive the attention and to take advantage of knowing something that other people don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s even probably a little bit of, I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s malicious, but a little bit of one‑upmans. Like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m helping you, because I&#8217;m able to do something that you can&#8217;t, so that gives me a little bit of self‑confidence boost,&#8221; or whatever.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#8217;ve even seen people help when it&#8217;s not even asked for and when it&#8217;s not wanted, just to have that either one‑upmans, or just to help out.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  One of the things I find very interesting is that people do not like to ask for help, but damn, do they like to give it out, even when it&#8217;s not solicited.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  We really like to rescue people, but we don&#8217;t like so much to ask people to help us, which is really odd to me. You think that it would be&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  The other way around.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  An even metering out.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Because helping people out has a way higher cost associated with it. It actually takes time.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Something in our wiring makes us want to help people. If we know that we like to help people, even when they don&#8217;t ask for it, wouldn&#8217;t we think that, when we want help, that&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  People who want to help?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  People would really want to help, but it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re wired the opposite way.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  If asking for help is cheap, and waiting too long to ask for help is very expensive, how do you create a culture of asking for help?</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  I think the same way you create a culture for anything you want, is you just have to model the hell out of it. I think you have to insist on it. You have to constantly be in a mode for modeling that behavior, potentially even asking for help when you don&#8217;t necessarily need it.</p>
<p>I think you also have to model that it&#8217;s OK to say &#8220;No,&#8221; so that you don&#8217;t create a culture where people feel obligated to help when they&#8217;ve got other priorities or other things, and that people don&#8217;t get offended when they&#8217;re told &#8220;No,&#8221; that they get a healthy dosage of what it&#8217;s like to ask for help and get it, but also ask for help and maybe not get it, or have it delayed, and that that&#8217;s OK, too.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that if I ask you for help and you say &#8220;No,&#8221; that it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll never help me again.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Or you hate me. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Or that you hate me, or there&#8217;s something personal, but that it just might be you&#8217;re really busy trying to do something else.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Or have no knowledge to help you.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Or I don&#8217;t have the ability to help. I think it&#8217;s just modeling that a lot. I think you have to model it a lot. I think it happens pretty quickly when you get results.</p>
<p>I think when you ask for help and you get help, it feels like you&#8217;re cheating. It&#8217;s almost like, &#8220;Damn, I&#8217;ve got the stables easy, but [indecipherable 09:19] smacking this sucker over and over again, and it&#8217;s getting easier and easier the more I do it.&#8221; I think that it becomes a pretty Pavlov response of, &#8220;I really like this thing, so I&#8217;m going to do it a little more often.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  You&#8217;re saying, if you are feeling like nobody around you is asking for help, that&#8217;s probably a good indication that you need to ask for help.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Yeah. I would say, if nobody is asking you for help, that probably means that you don&#8217;t ask anybody for help.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  I&#8217;m pretty sure, though, that the quantity that I think we have a mutual understanding of, is not what most people are thinking of what we&#8217;re talking about. I&#8217;m thinking about asking for help multiple times an hour, maybe a dozen, two dozen times an hour. That&#8217;s once every few minutes. That&#8217;s not once a day or twice a day. It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  How could you possibly need help that often?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  I do a lot of complicated stuff.</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  I&#8217;m a very dumb person, so I do a lot of&#8230;</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Can you give me some examples of how you&#8217;re asking&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Actually, you&#8217;re a very smart person, if you&#8217;re asking for help a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Can you give me some examples of how you asked for help today?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  [indecipherable 10:20] multiple times, where Jade and I were pairing, and I didn&#8217;t understand something, so I asked him to explain things that were going on, I asked you guys all for help in reminding me of something that I knew I had forgotten, and I was hoping you guys would know.</p>
<p>Likewise, I asked for help in remembering whether or not we were going to an event tomorrow, or next week Thursday, and I think there were several other times as well. I can&#8217;t remember all of them. Those are a just the ones that come to mind.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  I had to leave and you still ask me for help over IM.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  I think you asked for help quite a few times too, when you were off doing some completely unrelated.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Yeah, I left all my stuff somewhere, I asked you to help me bring it back.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  What does an organization that asks for help a lot look like? How does it look different than an organization that doesn&#8217;t ask for help?</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Noisy.</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Yeah, noisy. I think it&#8217;s a place that feels good, feels high energy. I think &#8220;Ease&#8221; would be a good word. It&#8217;s really easy to be part of an organization that asks for help a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  You probably have a lot of trust and appreciation for the people around you, because you&#8217;re constantly getting help from them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like, &#8220;I know I don&#8217;t have to worry about this, because I know you three got my back, because I&#8217;m asking for help all the time, and you&#8217;re responding positively. I don&#8217;t have to sit there and worry that someday in the future I ask for help for the first time and you guys will say, &#8216;No.'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  Do you think maybe one of the reasons why a lot of organizations struggle with asking for help, or don&#8217;t have a culture of it, is that maybe people are isolated?</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Yeah. I think just like you said, when it&#8217;s not right in your face, there is some weird psychological barrier. Even if it is pretty low and pretty cheap, if I can ask you a question right now that we&#8217;re sitting face‑to‑face, versus having to send you some sort of text message or something like that, that&#8217;s going to significantly lower my desire to ask for help for some reason, even though it&#8217;s still really easy.</p>
<p>I think if you&#8217;re not together, not even just physically, but if your presence is low, even virtually, it creates an enormous barrier to asking for help. I know I would feel like I&#8217;m inconveniencing someone. If I don&#8217;t know that they are present in here with me, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m interrupting them or causing them some sort of problem.</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Which is interesting, because they can then say &#8220;No.&#8221; If you&#8217;re interrupting somebody, there&#8217;s no reason they couldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Hey, no.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Yeah, they could certainly say &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Roy</strong>:  Or, &#8220;No, but try again in 10 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>:  I see this a lot. If I&#8217;m in a cube farm, or if I&#8217;m in an area with offices, the barrier for me to get up and go to somebody, while that&#8217;s not really high, it&#8217;s a lot higher than just turning around and asking them or looking across the desk. But I think the real barrier is it really feels like I&#8217;m interrupting them.</p>
<p>At our house with kids, and dogs, and animals, the bathroom is the sacred place. It&#8217;s the only place nobody bothers you. I think in a lot of companies, cubicles or offices become the sacred place. I see people walk up to cube walls and knock on the cube wall like it&#8217;s a door. Like &#8220;Knock, knock, can I come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>Think about the barrier to that. If I want help, I literally have to knock. I have no idea what you&#8217;re doing, I have no idea if I&#8217;m really interrupting you.</p>
<p>If I can physically see you and I can see, &#8220;Hey, you just hung up the phone, I know you&#8217;re done with that phone call,&#8221; it&#8217;s a logical time to say, &#8220;Hey.&#8221; If you&#8217;re really busy, you&#8217;ll say, &#8220;No,&#8221; but I know you&#8217;re on the phone. Whereas I get up, I walk over, you&#8217;re on the phone, do I stand there and wait? What happens?</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong>:  Yeah, that&#8217;s a really great point. That reminds me of when I was much younger, and managing my first team. I was much less wise then, and I had a private office, and nobody would ever come and talk to me.</p>
<p>They were making terrible decisions, and I was always mad and very unhappy with, &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t they asking me for help? I have these answers, I know how to help them, and they&#8217;re just not asking me for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember we decided to move. I moved out of that office, I moved in with the team, and that really made such a huge difference of just being physically available to them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all the time we have for the Agile Weekly Podcast. Thanks for listening. Talk to you next week.</p>
