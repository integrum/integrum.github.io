I have never been more proud. Since that conversation, I have shared our values with every new client and team I work with. I have asked them to hold everyone at Integrum accountable to them. It has led to some great conversation and keeps us living those values every day.<\/p>\n<p>A few years ago we made a bold decision to change the direction of the company. Identifying and codifying our values was one of the first things we did. We created them together and it is one of the most memorable days of my life. What came out of that process was extremely challenging and we made a commitment to live them out. I believe this has been one of our greatest successes as a company and has helped us create great change in the world around us.<\/p>\n<p>What are your values? Are you living them every day? I challenge you to live yours to the fullest for one month and see what a difference it makes.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Integrum Values and Principles<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We value <strong>courage<\/strong>.
