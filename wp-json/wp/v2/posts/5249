This is an opportunity for Integrum as a team to reflect on the week&#8217;s progress and discuss what improvements can be made for the next week. These meetings allow us to stay agile and adapt to our customers needs.<\/p>\n<p>The meeting begins by each team member giving a thumbs up, thumbs down or a sideways thumb to express general feelings on the sprint for the week. Agile Coach Derek Neighbors then divides the large whiteboard into three areas, (+) (-) and the delta symbol.
