The movement is growing, and you can be part of it.<\/p>\n<p>Gangplank is the new economic engine \u2013 one that thrives on trust, taking risks, collaboration, and most importantly, people. Instead of shunning the traditional corporations and government organizations that have stifled our culture, we embrace and engage them to be part of the change.<\/p>\n<p>Transforming cultures and cultivating leaders isn\u2019t just what we do for our day jobs. It\u2019s our passion. It\u2019s our calling. Anyone can say they\u2019re innovators, but it takes a special team to actually do it.
