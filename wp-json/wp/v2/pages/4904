Our coaches join forces with you to turn those challenges into successes. We know your team has it in them to be excellent. By teaching Agile principles, we help you and your team discover and deliver your true potential. Our deep background in Scrum, eXtreme Programming and Lean Software Development gives us the tools to unleash your creativity and unlock innovation currently hidden away inside your team.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Process<\/h3>\n<div class=\"column_left\">\n<p><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/integrum\/images\/approach\/user_stories.png\" alt=\"User Stories\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>User Stories<\/h4>\n<p>In order to ensure your software is built to work with various users and their needs, we do extensive user story workshops to map out all the possible routes a user could possibly take.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column_middle\">\n<p><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/integrum\/images\/approach\/velocity_charts.png\" alt=\"Velocity Charts\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Burndown Charts<\/h4>\n<p>Transparency is important.  Using visible burndown charts allows us to show work remaining over time.  The work remaining should jig up and down and eventually trend downward.  We post daily progress locally and show sprint progress weekly.  Additionally, we provide a release burndown chart to make visible the state of the product at any given time.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column_right\">\n<p><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/integrum\/images\/approach\/sprints.png\" alt=\"Sprints\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Sprints<\/h4>\n<p>We work in manageable chunks of time called sprints. This allows us to focus on the most important tasks first and work to their completion. By the end of the sprint you will receive pieces of functioning software.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Collaboration<\/h3>\n<div class=\"column_left\">\n<p><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/integrum\/images\/approach\/pairing.png\" alt=\"Pairing\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Pairing<\/h4>\n<p>Software is more efficiently built when done in pairs. Technical issues get discussed and solved quickly and allows for higher quality work at a faster pace. Each client will have a minimum of two developers on their project at all times.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column_middle\">\n<p><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/integrum\/images\/approach\/standups.png\" alt=\"Standups\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Standups<\/h4>\n<p>We begin each day with a recap of what we&#8217;ve done on our current projects, what we&#8217;re doing today, and what roadblocks we&#8217;ve hit. This allows the team and client to stay informed about their project&#8217;s status.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column_right\">\n<p><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/integrum\/images\/approach\/client_engagement.png\" alt=\"Client Engagement\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Client Engagement<\/h4>\n<p>Get used to hearing from us, because it&#8217;ll happen on a daily basis. We like to keep in touch with our clients at every step of their project so we&#8217;re always sure that we&#8217;re working on the most important tasks and so we can identify any problems early on.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"wide_column\">\n<h3>Gangplank<\/h3>\n<p>We are the creators of a unique environment called <a href=\"http:\/\/gangplankhq.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gangplank<\/a> located in Downtown Chandler, Arizona.
